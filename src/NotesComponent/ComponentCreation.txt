how to create component

1st way
1. create folder
2. we need to create 4 files
login.component.ts
login.component.html
login.component.css
login.component.spec.ts

3. register login component inside app.module.ts
4. use selector of the component and use it inside the files where we want it

second way
go to CLI enter one single command
- ng generate component login
or 
- ng g c login

5. passing value from parent component ot child components

<!-- 
1. create variable in parent component
2. pass this variable to child
3. goto template of parent and pass the value through property binding
4. create input variable in child 
5. display in template of child component
6.add the selector of parent into app.component.html

-->

6. passing value from child to parent

1. in child component create a event, this event will get value displayed from parent
2. it has to emit it to parent i.e. inform parent to show the value
3. by creating a output variable we will be able to emit it 
i.e. pass instruction to parent to show the value
4. parent will receive it from selector of child component present in parent template
5. it will call showmonth() and will display
